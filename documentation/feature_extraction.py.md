\# Feature Extraction

\# Assuming the DataFrame 'df' has columns for source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and payload

\# This is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual code for feature extraction

features = df\[\['Source\_IP', 'Destination\_IP', 'Source\_Port', 'Destination\_Port', 'Payload']]

labels = df\['Label']
